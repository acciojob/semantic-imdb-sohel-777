<summary>
    When astronauts blast off from the planet Mars, they leave behind 
	Mark Watney (Matt Damon), presumed dead after a fierce storm. 
	With only a meager amount of supplies, the stranded visitor 
	must utilize his wits and spirit to find a way to survive on 
	the hostile planet. Meanwhile, back on Earth, members of NASA 
	and a team of international scientists work tirelessly to bring
	him home, while his crew mates hatch their own plan for a daring
	rescue mission.
